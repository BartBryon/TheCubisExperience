                <p>Hey everyone, <br><br>
                    my name is <b>Bart</b> . I'm a last year <b>Information Management & Security</b> student at the
                    Thomas More College in Mechelen.
                    I've been specializing in Cyber Security for the past 2,5 years. It's a fascinating subject and
                    indispensible in today's business world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my studies I came in contact with the other specialization in our course, <b>Data
                        Management</b>.
                    Data has become a more valuable asset than oil and this intrigued me for two reasons:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - &nbsp It meant that this seamingly useless data can be gathered and analyzed and turned into a
                    marketable asset. <br>
                    - &nbsp It's one of the world's largest markets and I just wanted to know what it was all about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started messing around with it. Trying out software like Tableau and Power Bi.
                    It turned out that I really enjoyed the process of working with these tools and data in general.
                    That's Why I chose to follow an internship at <b>Cubis Solutions</b>,
                    A Business Intelligence Company that consults clients on what to do whith their huge amounts of
                    gathered data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topic of my internship is <b>Data Virtualization</b>. For the companies that have tonnes of data
                    but lack the time/ability to extract, transform or load their data, data virtualization might be the
                    ideal option.
                    So for the next 3 months I wil be comparing SAP's HANA and Power BI's ability for Direct Queries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm looking forward to it and I'm <b>ready to learn!</b>
                </p>
            </div>
